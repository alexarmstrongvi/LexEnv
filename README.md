## LexEnv

# How to use
To use these files, a symlink must be set in the appropriate place
Special cases:
    - .gitconfig - add into the ~/.gitconfig under an [include] heading "~/LexEnv/.gitconfig"
    - local\_bash\_profile.sh - contains any site specific configurations. Add a symlink called local\_bash\_profile.sh to any such file and it will be picked up by .bash\_profile
